## Problem Statement

Designing scalable, efficient, and clear system architectures is a complex and time-consuming task. Engineers often face challenges like:

- Struggling to visually organize intricate systems on static diagrams  
- Spending hours manually drafting and updating designs  
- Lack of intelligent assistance to suggest best practices, optimize layouts, or automate parts of the design process  
- Collaboration friction due to non-interactive or disconnected design tools  

These pain points slow down development, increase errors, and hinder effective communication between teams.
