# Scurd

**Scurd** is a next-generation **system architecture and design platform** for developers, software architects, and technology teams.  
It combines an **interactive canvas** with an **AI-powered assistant**, enabling effortless creation, collaboration, and optimization of system designs.

## 🌍 Vision

System design is the backbone of every successful technology product. Yet, existing tools are either **too simple** (static whiteboards, diagrams) or **too complex** (enterprise modeling software).  
Scurd bridges this gap by providing a **developer-first, AI-augmented design tool** that is:  

- **Visual** → Drag-and-drop, interactive architecture canvas  
- **Intelligent** → AI co-pilot for real-time suggestions and automation  
- **Collaborative** → Designed for teams to share, iterate, and scale together  

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Creating robust, scalable system architectures remains a **time-intensive and error-prone process**. Common challenges include:  

- Static diagram tools (e.g., Lucidchart, Draw.io) lack **intelligence** and **context**  
- Senior engineers spend hours on design communication, while juniors often **misinterpret architectures**, causing rework  
- Architecture documentation is frequently **outdated** or disconnected from real systems  
- Teams lose productivity when design tools are not integrated with modern workflows (Agile, DevOps)  

These issues lead to **inefficiency, technical debt, and slower time-to-market**.

## ✅ How Scurd Solves This

### 1. Interactive Canvas  
- Drag-and-drop **predefined system components** (DB, APIs, services, infra)  
- Connect nodes visually with edges representing data flow and dependencies  
- Customize with metadata: title, tech stack, description, logo, and colors  

### 2. Agentic AI Assistant  
- Generate **architecture blueprints** from natural language prompts  
- Suggest best practices for scalability, reliability, and performance  
- Provide **real-time feedback** on design flaws  
- Automatically update the canvas with an **Apply button** for AI suggestions  

### 3. Seamless Automation  
- AI-assisted **design iteration** → go from requirements → architecture → export  
- Export designs to **JSON (for dev handoff)** and **PNG (for reports/docs)**  
- Build **living architecture docs** that evolve with your system
